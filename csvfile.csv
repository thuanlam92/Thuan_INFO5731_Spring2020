1,i was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another joker based film i thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer but in here to say i was incredibly wrong this is a massive achievement of cinema thats extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots while this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past joaquin bleeds sweats and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance heath ledger would be proud this is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since heaths joker the directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout when this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a characters world and very existence believe the hype this is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema every once in a while a movie comes that truly makes an impact joaquins performance and scenography in all its brilliance grotesque haunting and cringy hard to watch at times but so mesmerizing you wont blink an eye watching it tragic but with seriously funny moments emotional rollercoaster  sometimes with multiple emotions poppingup at the same timethis is far from a typical actionriddled predictable superhero movie  its a proper psychological thrillerdrama with the single best character development i have ever seen this is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it you understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character a lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence but truly this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world instead of making them feel isolated truly a masterpiece the best hollywood film of  one of the best films of the decade and truly the best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife,Positive
2,remarkable direction cinematography music and the acting,Positive
3,some people are surprised to find it disturbing and violent but its a necessity and message,Neutral
4,its about society and reflects those underappreciatedunrecognizedbullied people proving they can do something too,Neutral
5,the way it shows class difference corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and thats what makes it different,Positive
6,its believable,Positive
7,there could be multiple jokers living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people,Positive
8,consider this a wake up call a message but first a film a perfect film most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short way short joker is the first time i was more than happy with the hype please ignore the complaints of pernicious violence as they are embarrassing to say the least we havent seen a comic movie this real before if we ever deserved a better class of criminal  phillips and phoenix have delivered this is dark joker is dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should the bad guys are always more romantic anyway joaquin phoenix gives a tour de force performance fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality its impossible to talk about this without referencing heath ledgers oscarwinning performance from the dark knight widely considered the definitive liveaction portrayal of the joker so lets talk about it the fact is everyone is going to be stunned by what phoenix accomplishes because its what many thought impossible  a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of the dark knights clown prince of crime let me start off by saying if joaquin phoneix doesnt get his oscar for this movie then the oscars should be cancelled phoneix is amazing as you mightve heard from every review ever but todd phillips is at his best here the story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking the score omg the score every time that score came on i felt very uncomfortable like something horrible was about to happen it was great the inspirations from taxi driver and king of comedy are there and add so much for the movie and i got to be honest there are scenes that are very violent and its disturbing but i honestly expected it to be wayyyy more violent from all the controversy going on overall this movie was great come oscar season it needs to be nominated for best picture screenplay cinematography actor score and director i get why some people hate this  its because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for arthurs madness but come on that is not the point and it will never be enjoy this masterpiece because joaquin phoenix and todd phillips overdid themselves with this movie  the actingmusic and cinematography are just amazing  please enjoy the movie without overthinking it i have seen joker yesterday at venice an early illfated screening we had some trouble with audio that lead to a nearhour delay but it definitely was worth itjoker deserved to be presented at venice film festival an event that regards cinema as a form of art because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie as most films in the genre areit focuses on the psyche of the main character as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society and thus joaquin phoenix does a wonderful performance earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least,Positive
9,its a take on the joker that differs from ledgers but id say that both are equally as good the main difference might be that ledgers joker is a rational that acts insane while phoenixs is insane to the rootdespite being a movie about a superhero villain joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre id exclude the dark knight trilogy only but joker is easily as good as nolans movies or at least very close it is a smallscaled film with a distinct style and cinematography that cannot but be appreciated and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive most notable are the similarities to scorseses taxi driver and his the king of comedy but also chaplins modern times is somewhat referencedi am eager to see more noncomedic efforts by todd phillips this movie was so far probably the best of  at worst contested so far only by dolor y gloria or once upon a time in hollywood and that should be very convincing its sad that joaquin missed oscar for the gladiator as he was very compelling villain but i am quite confident he will win it for the joker damn what a movie  keeps u on the toes all the time unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot did i forget to mention acting  damn do niro and joaquin teach u what really is  star acting,positive
10,to enjoy this movie get a wine in your hand close the curtains turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door best dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience i have just watched the joker in venice and i will say if joaquin doesnt get an oscar this year then something is wrong with this world this perfomance is just jawdropping it glues you to the screen and doesnt let go till the end story is very good and has some interesting connections with batman loreespecially one you cant guess from trailers there are some scenes that are so tense wellacted and imaginative that push this movie to  cinematography and direction are great todd has proven himself as a director robert is also good in his small role will definitely see it again as soon as it out in october this movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality particularly the poor choices made by the joker the joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are i think this gives a more realistic view of bad people who are not usually  bad in all ways as society often judges it is important to know when to sympathize with the joker towards the beginning of the movie and when he needs to be identified as a threat when he begins making certain bad choices this movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it it isnt for light amusement that substance is what makes it so goodif you arent able to ponder underlying themes on your own and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you then this isnt the best movie for you the acting cinematography sound design and the script itself is phenomenal this movie is a triumph joaquin pheonix deserves an oscar win for this tbh i will stop watching movies if joaquin phoenix is not awarded oscar for his tremendous acting i quit relying on critic reviews years ago i noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high that being said what is the point of a critic when for this movie they are oh so wrong,positive
11,i went and saw this tonite with my mom i went in skeptical and w some what low expectations i knew not to expect your typical super hero movie,neutral
12,what we got was a masterpiece i went in expecting sheer boredom and i was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time not action edge of your seat it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat to see this character evolve into what we all know as the  villain of batman was beyond genius and joaquin phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character i may be all over the place with this but i dont care this movie the story the acting directing effects everyone brought their a game and jp definitely deserves a nod and win for this role and no there is no comparison here to jack nicholson or heath ledger each actor took on this character and different levels different story points and different points in time so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way need i say more everything about this movie is masterful in every single way joker isnt just an awesome comic book movie its an awesome movie period it offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline joaquin phoenixs fully committed performance and todd phillips masterful albeit loose reinvention of the dc source material make joker a film that should leave comic book fans and nonfans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways im speechless this is one of my favorite movies  and its the best joaquin phoenix gives one of the best performances ive ever seen yes i think he should absolutely win an oscar for his portrayal as the iconic character heath ledger is still my favorite joker but joaquin is pretty close to the level of ledger todd phillips did a phenomenal job directing i think this is his best work to date robert de niro is not given much screen time but he takes advantage of the time hes given and he shines the costume design and makeup is great as well and i think it should be nominated for a major award the script is incredible im going to be quoting a lot of the lines for days the violence in this movie was not even that bad compared to other films that have had this amount of controversy i would like to take a minute and say that films and other media do not cause violence this is not a dangerous film the last thirty minutes of this movie are absolutely insane i wont be able to forget them the death scene on the murray franklin show is absolutely crazy and i did not see it coming despite the fact that arthur fleck joker is a mass murderer i couldnt help but feel bad for his character at times i didnt forgive him for the things he did but at the same time i did sympathize with him i really liked the progression of arthurs character you see him slowly growing more and more insane as the seconds go by the runtime was perfect it never felt boring i loved this movie and theres so much more i want to talk about joaquin phoenix gives heath ledger a run for his money true story this is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick do not take your kids to see this movie shut down all ballots for the oscar joaquin is taking that one home hands down one of the best origin stories ever put out the only downside to this movie is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the dc universe todd philips take on the joker is one of pure brilliance and joaquin phoenix was the joker we deserved he didnt steal from jack or heath but yet you got a taste of both the music the intense the realism the performance the story such a perfect combination of everything i never felt that a character like joker could be real until i saw this phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music camera angles lighting and every important factor overall i did not expect the story to be this perfect too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent todays society if i was in the first screening i would have applauded for  min not  the perfect portrait of a decline to insanity,positive
13,amp joaquin phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime,neutral
14,choreographed impeccably by todd phillips amp is nothing short of breathtaking,positive
15,the cinematography amp backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack amp acting a hauntingly beautiful film amp a definate ,positive
16,edit bring on part  plssssss we all want it joaquin portrayal of a sociopathic mentally unstable mans transformation to the iconic joker was non other than a grippingly accurate realistic and touching rendition a dark and disturbing character piece led by an oscar worthy performance by joaquin phoenix you really do feel bad for this guy which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love although weve never seen him like this we see him suffer throughout the movie to the point were almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown because that at least will make feel better then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided because es so messed up we feel for him and care about him by the time hes the joker we wish we couldve helped him theres a lot of great nods to the greater batman universe yet the movie is a self contained character piece that can only be the mark of a great movie all the acting is great the plot while similar to taxi driver is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you dont need cgi super powers to be a great villain in a superhero movie is a joke not everyone gets this movie is the rise of the joker  phoenix convinces me that he has always meant to be the joker the movie went beyond my expectations so many emotions went through me these couple hours i think because its rated r phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be this was an amazing story and it calls for more and i mean a build up a second movie maybe one with batman my hopes are too high at this point but nevertheless brilliant goddamn movie and the best joker ever played hands down the pool does not need the money they need the dignity and respect coz that is what it takes to be a human if you dont have that money will only be a reminder of them being a good boy like some politicians they feel so frustrated when people from the lower class does not accept their funding champions in this movie through jokers life i begin to get it  amazing story brilliant taking magnificent cinematography,negative
17,someone had to step out of the safe game played by superhero movies and joker movie does just that also the boys movie is gritty real insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who dont want accept whats shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care,positive
18,normally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like the dark knight and in acting wise to that of heath ledgers potrayal of joker,neutral
19,i wouldnt say this movie is better that that or otherwise  but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like the godfather taxi driver citizen kane the dark knight,neutral
20,coming to the inevitable comparison of whos the better joker heath or joaquin the answer is both did a phenomenal job and the joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors,neutral
21,definitely a top contender for oscars i personally think it would take away,positive
22,best actor cinematography original score and if once upon a time in hollywood loses in makeup and hairstyling category it would definitely be to the joker seriously unbelievable dare i say better than heath ledger if joaquin phoenix doesnt win the oscar for best actor and joker doesnt win at the very least best screenplay it will be one of the biggest oscar snubs of our time,positive
